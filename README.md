Card meta-strategy Man-In-The-Middle is the game where you deliberately mess up the graphical user interfaces of other players by typing in the commands in your GUI. 
Is being developed with Python 3 and PySide2. See serverless-demo branch for... yes, serverless demo!

Finished: GUI design and behaviour, internal logic mechanisms 
In the near future: local server process, actual game content

Project lives on developer's need of practice, love for game design idea, and hate for PySide2.
One day it will be released on itch.io. Or at least I hope so!
